# Portfolio
Portfolio of the projects I have worked on

Nonlinear Equation Simulation - The code for the plotting and numerical analysis of a system of nonlinear differential equations trying to find chaos. It was based around a model we had created for a town that had the ability to invest in its infrastructure but coupled with having to control its wages with a larger "utopia" that had static wages and a static infrastructure.

New York City Traffic Exploration - The code for looking at New York City's open data on traffic accidents dating back to 2012. I hope to look at this data to look at trends of accident severity, location, and other exploratory factors and to create a machine learning model to determine whether or not we could predict accident severity and whether someone may be injured or killed in an accident. 

Wildfire Exploration and Analysis - A personal project using Python to explore the trends of deforestation and the importance of wildfires on deforestation. It also looks into the recent trend of increased wildfires over the past 20+ years.
