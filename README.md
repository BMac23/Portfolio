Nonlinear Equation Simulation - The code for the plotting and numerical analysis of a system of nonlinear differential equations trying to find chaos. It was based around a model we had created for a town that had the ability to invest in its infrastructure but coupled with having to control its wages with a larger "utopia" that had static wages and a static infrastructure.
